# Portfolio

This project was made as a portfolio for projects Iâ€™ve done both in school and in my free time. Both web- and graphic design projects as well as photography which is a hobby of mine. I wanted to use colors and styles that represent me and a design that I personally enjoy. I also wanted to make a fun and playful yet professional design.

Figma was used for this project. 
For the code HTML and SCSS was used for this project, and JavaScript for the responsive menu. For the fade up effect JavaScript aos was used, see github page here: [click here](https://github.com/michalsnik/aos)
